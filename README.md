# LearnGit
still learning git
im not really sure but i think it's good to alway start on
coding is always a hobby 
just hope you can spare time for othe courses
be smart and study less
is it good cause now i'm typing like super slow
i think i can improve whenever i want 
by whenever i want i mean that when i start working on it, but the quesion is when ?
